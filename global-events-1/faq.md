# FAQ

## What is an announcement and a security information?

### **ANNOUNCEMENT**

An announcement is a security-related incident that can be expected in the future, such as strikes and demonstrations.

### SECURITY INFORMATION

A security information is an incident information you receive via email when setting a favourite on the global events page or for a specific country on the country risks page. Once the system detects an incident that matches your favourite, you will receive an email with the incident information.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that security information for an incident with impact low and elevated do not include recommendations.
{% endhint %}

Additionally, you can schedule a **periodic alert digest** of all events which match this favourite.
