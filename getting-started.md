### EMERGENCY BUTTON

CALL FOR ASSISTANCE

In critical situations, the traveller can push the  button and will be automatically connected with the designated AXA Operation Center. This feature is specifically important for travellers that are in a life-threatening situation, simply pushing the button will initiate a direct call to the Operation Centre and trigger subsequent emergency procedures. 

### SCREEN SPLITTER / VIEWS

Depending on the size of the screen you use, there are different screen splits available. As you navigate through the different pages and use the platform you can adjust the screen views to your preferences with one or two clicks on the view mode icon, always placed in the upper left corner of the screen. In all mobile views you can switch from the navigation panel to map view with one click on the map icon and back.
