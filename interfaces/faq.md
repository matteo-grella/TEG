# FAQ

## How can I reset my login credentials?

This depends on the login mechanism you use. If you use username and password just click “_Forgot your password?_” on the login page and follow the instructions. If you use SAML or email token, you don’t have login credentials. For email token login just start the process again to receive an email token link. Please note that your email domain in your company email address must be white-listed for using email token. You also need access to your company email address. In case of SAML, just click on the link provided by your company. For this to work you must have a valid company account and be connected to your company’s infrastructure.

## Why am I not able to login?

1. **Your account may be locked**. This can have several reasons. First, it can happen if you tried to login with the wrong credentials too often. In this case you will get unlock instructions via email automatically. Please follow them. If you didn’t receive them, just click “_Didn’t receive unlock instructions?_” on the login page.
2. It is also possible that **you got disabled by you administrator** or the whole company got disabled \(e.g. your contract expired\). Please check with your administrator for help

## How can I temporarily prevent a user from login without deleting him?

Just go to the admin area to users and edit the user. There you find the check box to disable the user.
