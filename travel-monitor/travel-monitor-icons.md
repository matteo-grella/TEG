# Status and Icons

On the travel monitor map we use the following icons.

![](../.gitbook/assets/travelmonitoricons.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Several travellers, sites and alerts in the same location \(depending on the zoom level\) are grouped in one icon. Click on the group icon to separate the information on each grouped object.
{% endhint %}

The traveller icons have different colours, depending on their **status within the past 72 hours**:

| Colour | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
